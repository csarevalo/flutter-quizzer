**Up for a challenge?**

Give it a try. It's available on the [web](https://csarevalo.github.io/flutter-quizzer/). Enjoy.

Built with Flutter and BLoC.

## Purpose ðŸš€
Learn to develop flutter apps using BLoC, employ thorough testing, and implement simple animations (confetti!).
* Transform a beginner quiz app from using stateful widgets to employing the BLoC pattern.
* Included a question repository to separate questions from the logic
* Separated common views through Bloc Builder.
